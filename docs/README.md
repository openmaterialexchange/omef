# Welcome to EMOF - Open Material Echange Format

OMEF proposes an open-source data model to standardize quality and manufacturing data in the metallurgical industry. By addressing the lack of standardization, the model aims to unlock the potential of valuable data, enabling better insights and efficiency. It envisions a data marketplace, faster government approvals, and a collaborative industrial ecosystem. The technical framework prioritizes simplicity, extensibility, and security, encouraging active involvement from stakeholders to drive industry-wide innovation. The call to action urges engagement in the project to create a transformative, data-driven future for metallurgical manufacturing.
